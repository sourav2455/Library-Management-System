                        Prologue:Maddie Goldbloom stitched up a plan to ensure everything in her life was perfect—from a career
                        in fashion to a chic NYC apartment to a pediatrician boyfriend.
                        <br>
                        When her ex, Chase Black, storms back into her life with an outrageous request, her immediate reaction
                        is to refuse him. But he only wants to fulfill his father’s last wish. So even though he’s the man who
                        broke her heart, playing his fiancée shouldn’t be hard, especially if it means she gets to watch the
                        arrogant devil squirm a bit.
                        <br>
                        What ensues is a chain of events that detonates Maddie’s life—and when Chase’s walls come down, they
                        both are forced to face reality.
                        <br>
                        They say keep your enemies close. But what if your enemy is also the man you love?

                    Prologue:In the ballrooms and drawing rooms of Regency London, rules abound. From their earliest days,
                    children of aristocrats learn how to address an earl and curtsey before a prince—while other dictates of
                    the ton are unspoken yet universally understood. A proper duke should be imperious and aloof. A young,
                    marriageable lady should be amiable… but not too amiable.
                    <br>
                    Daphne Bridgerton has always failed at the latter. The fourth of eight siblings in her close-knit
                    family, she has formed friendships with the most eligible young men in London. Everyone likes Daphne for
                    her kindness and wit. But no one truly desires her. She is simply too deuced honest for that, too
                    unwilling to play the romantic games that captivate gentlemen.
                    <br>
                    Amiability is not a characteristic shared by Simon Basset, Duke of Hastings. Recently returned to
                    England from abroad, he intends to shun both marriage and society—just as his callous father shunned
                    Simon throughout his painful childhood. Yet an encounter with his best friend’s sister offers another
                    option. If Daphne agrees to a fake courtship, Simon can deter the mamas who parade their daughters
                    before him. Daphne, meanwhile, will see her prospects and her reputation soar.
