                    Prologue:If you’ve ever spent hours renaming files or updating hundreds of spreadsheet cells, you
                    know
                    how tedious tasks like these can be. But what if you could have your computer do them for you?
                    <br>
                    In Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, you’ll learn how to use Python to write programs that do
                    in
                    minutes what would take you hours to do by hand—no prior programming experience required. Once
                    you’ve
                    mastered the basics of programming, you’ll create Python programs that effortlessly perform useful
                    and
                    impressive feats of automation to:<br>
                    –Search for text in a file or across multiple files<br>
                    –Create, update, move, and rename files and folders<br>
                    –Search the Web and download online content<br>
                    –Update and format data in Excel spreadsheets of any size<br>
                    –Split, merge, watermark, and encrypt PDFs<br>
                    –Send reminder emails and text notifications<br>
                    –Fill out online forms<br>

                    Step-by-step instructions walk you through each program, and practice projects at the end of each
                    chapter challenge you to improve those programs and use your newfound skills to automate similar
                    tasks.
                    <br>
                    Don’t spend your time doing work a well-trained monkey could do. Even if you’ve never written a line
                    of
                    code, you can make your computer do the grunt work. Learn how in Automate the Boring Stuff with
                    Python.

                Prologue:All our lives are constrained by limited space and time, limits that give rise to a particular
                set of problems. What should we do, or leave undone, in a day or a lifetime? How much messiness should
                we accept? What balance of new activities and familiar favorites is the most fulfilling? These may seem
                like uniquely human quandaries, but they are not: computers, too, face the same constraints, so computer
                scientists have been grappling with their version of such issues for decades. And the solutions they've
                found have much to teach us.
                <br>
                In a dazzlingly interdisciplinary work, acclaimed author Brian Christian and cognitive scientist Tom
                Griffiths show how the algorithms used by computers can also untangle very human questions. They explain
                how to have better hunches and when to leave things to chance, how to deal with overwhelming choices and
                how best to connect with others. From finding a spouse to finding a parking spot, from organizing one's
                inbox to understanding the workings of memory, Algorithms to Live By transforms the wisdom of computer
                science into strategies for human living.
