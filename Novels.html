                Prologue:F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby is distinguished as one of the greatest texts for
                introducing students to the art of reading literature critically (which means you may have read it in
                school). The novel is told from the perspective of a young man named Nick Carraway who has recently
                moved to New York City and is befriended by his eccentric nouveau riche neighbor with mysterious
                origins, Jay Gatsby. The Great Gatsby provides an insider’s look into the Jazz Age of the 1920s in
                United States history while at the same time critiquing the idea of the “American Dream.” Perhaps the
                most-famous aspect of the novel is its cover art—a piercing face projected onto a dark blue night sky
                and lights from a cityscape—an image that is also found, in a slightly different configuration, within
                the text itself as a key symbol.

                Prologue:Harper Lee, believed to be one of the most influential authors to have ever existed, famously
                published only a single novel (up until its controversial sequel was published in 2015 just before her
                death). Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird was published in 1960 and became an immediate classic of literature.
                The novel examines racism in the American South through the innocent wide eyes of a clever young girl
                named Jean Louise (“Scout”) Finch. Its iconic characters, most notably the sympathetic and just lawyer
                and father Atticus Finch, served as role models and changed perspectives in the United States at a time
                when tensions regarding race were high. To Kill a Mockingbird earned the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in
                1961 and was made into an Academy Award-winning film in 1962, giving the story and its characters
                further life and influence over the American social sphere.
